# Level up in Runescape Faster!
These scripts are used in Runescape to train certain skills such as fishing, woodcutting, mining etc. 

Auto dropper script drops items which are useful in training skills which require emptying the inventory such as fishing and woodcutting.

FireMaker script makes fire. Just place Tinderbox in first inventory slot and logs in the others.

DISCLAIMER: These scripts were created by me solely to have fun and make levelling not that notorious. These are by no way affiliated with JAGEX.
